## About  
I am a Swedish-born visual artist exploring trauma, memory, and transformation through abstract forms and layered symbolism.  
My work is both a mirror and a map—of the self, of silence, and of healing.  

As a Human Mind Prototype Artist and Neuro-Emotional Archivist, I code lived experience through pigment, memory, and light.  
Each piece in The Self Series is a node—a signal in a larger emotional and symbolic system.
